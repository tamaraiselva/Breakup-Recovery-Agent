# Breakup Recovery Assistant

A comprehensive application that provides emotional support and guidance for individuals going through a breakup. The application uses AI agents to offer therapeutic support, closure guidance, recovery planning, and honest feedback.

## Features

- ü§ù **Therapist Agent**: Provides empathetic support and validation
- ‚úâÔ∏è **Closure Agent**: Helps craft emotional messages and find closure
- üìÖ **Routine Planner**: Creates a 7-day recovery plan
- üí™ **Brutal Honesty Agent**: Gives direct feedback and truth

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI application with multiple AI agents using the Agno library
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface for user interaction
- **Integration**: Python script to run both services together

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file with your API key:

   ```env
   API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
   API_URL=http://localhost:8000/analyze/
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Run both services with a single command

```bash
python run_app.py
```

This will start both the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend, and open your browser automatically.

### Option 2: Run services separately

Start the FastAPI backend:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Start the Streamlit frontend (in a separate terminal):

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Usage

2. Optionally upload relevant images
3. Click "Get Support" to receive personalized guidance
